# MUWOM-pattern-generator
A visual pattern generator inspired by inuit singing, written in python

Launch from terminal as python MUWOM.py [chant1] [chant2]
where chants are composed of the characters M,O,W,U. Any case is fine and other characters are treated as an O. On their respective axes M pulls, W pushes, O is neutral except for the case (O,O) where it acts as a 'conductor' - lines pass through in the same direction and lastly U flips the direction.
